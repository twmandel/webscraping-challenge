In this challenge we used several tools including: Splinter, Beautiful Soup, HTML and Web Scraping. We used these tools to collect, organize, analyze and visualize data from a website regarding Mars. Regarding the code in the first cell of each of the two Jupyter Notebooks - I simply could not get chromedriver to work in the traditional way. I spent hours on zoom with my professor, ASKBCS, and a few of my fellow students working on chromedriver to no avail. The eventual solution was the following. The first thing I did was identify what version of chrome I had. Then I went to this website https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/chrome-for-testing#json-api-endpoints and used the json to pinpoint the exact download url. After downloading, I went to my finder and dragged the executable file from my downloads into /usr/local/bin. From there, I opened the executable file using Open With (Terminal). You have to click allow after opening this, or nothing will work. From there I opened up the assignment in my jupyter notebook. I added a new cell above the first cell and entered in the code that I got from my classmate Alex Gilmore.
